🌟🌟🌟 Day 18: Add features 🦎🖖. 🌟🌟🌟
Santa plays a lot with the elves to "Rock, paper, scissors" but they are not necessarily fair-play...
So he decided to specify who wins when by using a program on his own.

He has written the specifications here in a feature file that he used as an input to develop his program.

He would like to extend this program by adding Lizard and Spock like explained below:

Change the program to support Spock and Lizard for Santa 🖖

✅🚀 Challenge: Add the new features to the existing program using BDD. 🚀✅
