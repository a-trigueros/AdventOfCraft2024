ðŸŒŸðŸŒŸðŸŒŸ Day 10: Fix a bug. ðŸŒŸðŸŒŸðŸŒŸ

Santa came to the office this morning with a long face. He did not seem happy even after a festive night.
Looking at Teo's straight face, something was off...

One release went wrong yesterday apparently. Maybe it was related to that.

In order to deliver the presents, Santa uses the navigation system designed by the elves.

The system seems to be buggy... one test is now failing and is blocking the release.

Please fix the bug so the release can go on ðŸŽ…

# Thoughts

It was a very fun one, I enjoyed it a lot.
I still feel that I moved forward a bit too fast.
I didn't see either the need for a strategy pattern, even though the exercice was nearly asking for it.

But I feel very satisfied with what's the solution look like.
I discovered alias types and am still balancing and trying to assess the plus and minus.
On one hand, it expresses business strongly, on the other hand, this is just another name for an existing type, they don't secure as much as a wrapper type would.

The more it goes, the more I have a feeling that expression body members are a hint of a good design.
